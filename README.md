# Runner
Wrote this in Grade 10 (was taking a Grade 11 CS course).
Basic two-player running game based on the flash game [Sprinter](https://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/sprinter/sprinter.html).

**Current version is v0.8** \
This version has an issue with framerate, it seems that the longer you play the slower the game runs. (This could be due to sprite management issues/issues with Python)
